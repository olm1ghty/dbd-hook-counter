# DBD Hook Counter
## *Display hook stages when playing killer*
![ui example](https://imgur.com/a/7cPc0tD)

This is a Dead by Daylight hook counter for killers (with additional features).

## Features

    - Fully automatic (analyzes visual data on the screen)
    - Has manual controls if you don't like automatic tracking
    - Hook counter
    - DS timer
    - Off-hook endurance timer
    - Supports 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios
    - Doesn't trigger anti-cheat
    - Doesn't breach EULA (it's as legal as putting a note on the screen)

## How to use
> Disclaimer: Works with DBD in `Windowed Fullscreen` mode. Doesn't work in Fullscreen mode. 

    1. Launch the app.
    2. Shift + M to open settings.
    3. Set your Aspect Ratio based on your screen resolution.
    4. Set UI and HUD scale to match those you have in DBD's graphics settings.
    5. Save settings.
    6. Play DBD while this app is running, and it will do its thing automatically.

You will know that it's set up correctly by seeing empty hook counters on the UI (only when the match starts):
